Thank you very much for visiting our website! The following is the purpose for which our group was established.

<!--more-->

WeAI Research Group is dedicated to research related to artificial intelligence. As a start-up research group, we do not have sufficient computing resources, technical reserves and financial support. However, this does not prevent us from loving AI research.

Our limitations make us realize that there are many researchers who are also interested in AI research who also face the dilemma of inadequate support. Therefore, our group was established to pursue the following goals.

* First, we are committed to researching and promoting AI technologies that are applicable to low hardware conditions.
* Secondly, we hope to create a technology communication platform to start timely communication with our peers.
* Finally, we welcome you to join our group and expand the boundaries of technology applications together.

Obviously, our group is still at an initial stage where we can only produce simple models and publish simple journal and conference papers. However, we will keep our hobby of AI alive and well. Whether you are an expert, a student or even an amateur, we look forward to talking with you.
