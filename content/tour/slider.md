      content: 'Our limitations make us realize that there are many researchers who are also interested in AI research but who also face the dilemma of inadequate support. Therefore, our group was established to pursue the following goals. First, we are committed to researching and promoting AI technologies that are applicable to low hardware conditions. Secondly, we hope to create a technological communication platform to start timely communication with our peers. Finally, we welcome you to join our group and expand the boundaries of technology applications together.'
