title: Optimization and application of dendritic neuron model
abstract: >-
  As the well-known McCulloch–Pitts neuron model has long been criticized for
  being oversimplified, different algebra to formulate a single neuron model has
  received increasing interest. The dendritic neuron model (DNM) which considers
  the nonlinear information processing capacity of both synapses and dendrites
  has shown its effectiveness on classification problems. However, an effective
  learning method for DNM is still highly desired and challenging because the
  traditional error back-propagation (BP) algorithm usually suffers from issues
  originating from the proliferation of saddle points and local minima
  trapping. 


  In addition to BP, the mainstream DNM optimization methods include meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs). However, over the decades, MHAs have developed a large number of different algorithms. How to screen suitable MHAs for optimizing DNM has become a hot and challenging area of research. In this study, we classified MHAs into different clusters with different population interaction networks (PIN). The performance of DNMs optimized by different clusters of MHAs is tested in the prediction and classification tasks.
