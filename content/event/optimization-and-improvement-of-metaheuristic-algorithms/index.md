title: Optimization and improvement of metaheuristic algorithms
abstract: >-
  Addressing optimization problems is crucial in the study of a wide range of
  scientific and engineering issues. Therefore, new methods are emerging and
  being used to meet the new challenges of science and engineering. When it is
  difficult or impossible to find the optimal solution to a problem, such as
  NP-complete problems, a heuristic method is one way of quickly arriving at a
  viable solution. It is a strategy that provides feasible solutions in a
  reasonable amount of time and space but does not guarantee the best solution.
  A meta-heuristic is a generalized heuristic method that can be applied to a
  broader range of situations than the specific conditions of a particular
  problem. 


  According to the well-known “No-Free-Lunch Theorem”, different meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs) have corresponding advantages and disadvantages in addressing different optimization problems. Even so, much effort is still dedicated to creating algorithms that perform well on most problems. In recent decades, researchers appear to have concluded that maintaining a balance between exploitation and exploration is critical for improving MHAs’ performance. According to the latest definition of exploitation and exploration, the term “exploitation” refers to the idea of focusing the search process on promising areas of the solution space, whereas the ability of a search algorithm to discover a diverse array of solutions spread across different regions of the search space is emphasized by the term “exploration”. However, although new attempts to adjust the balance between exploitation and exploration are constantly being made, the issue of how to efficiently balance exploitation and exploration in algorithms remains a hot area of research.
