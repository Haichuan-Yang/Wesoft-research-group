title: Designing neural networks based on dendritic neuron model
abstract: >-
  The dendritic neuron model (DNM), which considers the nonlinear information
  processing capability of synapses and dendrites, has more robust performance
  and interpretability than the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model. However, most
  research on DNM has been limited to single neurons. How to use DNMs to form
  neural networks and solve real-world problems is a complex problem to be
  solved.


  At present, we use ResNet, which is very powerful in deep learning, to combine with DNM to design DResNet with stronger performance. DResNet has shown powerful ability in COVID-19 detection problems. It can accurately detect patients with COVID-19 with over 98% accuracy. In the future, we will realize the use of DNM to compose more complex neural networks and apply them to various hard-to-solve practical problems.
