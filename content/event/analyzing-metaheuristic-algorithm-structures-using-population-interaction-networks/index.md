title: Analyzing metaheuristic algorithm structures using population interaction
  networks
abstract: In the real life, many people and things have complex relationships.
  These relationships can be abstracted as complex networks, such as social
  networks, Internet-of-Things networks, and traffic networks. Over the past
  several decades, complex networks have received a lot of attention and
  flourished in many fields. Generally, complex networks are composed of nodes
  and edges. A node represents an individual and an edge means the relationship
  between two nodes. They can reflect some characteristics of various networks,
  such as small world, scale-free (i.e., power-law distribution), and community
  structure. These characteristics let people understand the rules of complex
  networks and explain certain phenomenons in the real world. Thus, complex
  networks as one kind of tools can analyze the essence of research objectives
  and improve their robustness.
